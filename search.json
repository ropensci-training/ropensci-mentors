When we build this training material, we think about this persona:\n\nFausti\n\nsent their packages to rOpenSci review process a couple of years ago. The process ensured the quality of their software and facilitated its publication in JOSS, which gave them academic credit. Also, getting the rOpenSci badge as an international organization helped other colleagues take their software products more seriously and as valid research products. Fausti volunteered to review packages in Spanish, and advised other colleagues to send their packages to review because their experience was very good. Fausti learned about the champions program and volunteered to mentor because they can give back to the community. It is also, a way to be trained as a mentor, which is a good skill for their academic role and to increase their contact network.\n\n\nDuring this training and orientation, Fausti will gain mentoring skills (active listening, effective questioning, giving feedback), will receive resources for their mentoring role such as the Mentors Guidelines, Meeting Templates and details of the logistics of the champions program.",

    "text": "Training\n\nTime to connect.\nStart the meeting a few minutes early, allow people to enter, and check the video and audio. Be sure they can listen and see you. Let them know it is ok if they don’t turn on their camera. Share the document you will be using as shared notes on the chat.\nWhen everyone arrives, remember the rules of participation, like the code of conduct and how to use it. Mention a short agenda for the day:\n\nWe will see tools for your role as mentor and logistic about the program. We will also shared resources we build for you, to help you with your role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipShared document\n\n\n\nPeople can’t access the previous chat when they join a meeting. So share the doc one last time when all the attendees are there. Also, share the doc before each exercise to be sure all students can access it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRecording\n\n\n\nIf you will record the sesion, this is a good time to ask for permission. Be clear on how you will use the recording and with whom you will share it.\n\n\n\n\nStart the training\nYou can start with the first exercise: Mentorship Reflection. (you can decide if you want to share the slides with the exercises, the shared doc with the exercises, or not share the screen).\n\nWe will start with an exercise: Mentorship Reflection. Please think of an experience you’ve had as a mentor or being mentored. Use the shared doc to answer the questions next to your name (in alphabetical order).\n\nRead the questions aloud and give some more examples on what to think to answer:\n\nWhat went well / what was helpful?” “What was that relationship like? How did it help you? What is one helpful thing your mentor/mentee said/did?\nWhat didn’t work? What you needed, and your mentor/mentee couldn’t help you? or didn’t understand you?\nThink of a problem you’d like mentoring on right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTime for activities\n\n\n\nAlways clarify at the beggining of the activity how much time we have for doing it. “We will use 10 minutes for this exercise”, “We will take a 10 minutes break”\n\n\nGive them one-two minutes to write in silence. Then you can read some of the answers aloud or add some comments on the doc in silence. Encourage them to read their classmate’s answers and do comments.\n\n\nMentors roles. Mentorship skills\nYou continue with slide three about the mentors’ roles.\n\nWhat do mentors do? Mentors advise and inspire. How do you do this?. Recommend resources, readings, training, experiences. Feedback to consider. Connect to people, programs, and organizations.\n\nYou should give examples of each activity related to the type of project they will be mentoring. On slide four, you summarise the mentorship skills we will see today:\n\nActive Listening, Effective Questioning, Giving Feedback.\n\nShow slide five now about active listening. Before showing some bullets point, you start with a question:\n\nPlease, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer: What is active listening? How active listening looks like?\n\nGive them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Iterate on what they said. They will be able to mention helpful information you can note when you show the bullet point about active listening. For example, someone can share that active listening is when people ask good and insightful questions. Or when they pay attention to you (they aren’t watching their phone or answering their email).\nNow follows with slide six about effective questioning. Before showing effective questioning concepts and tips, make the questions:\n\nWhy questions are important in mentoring? What kind of questions are helpful?. Please, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer\n\nGive them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Give priority to the people that don’t participate in the previous question. Iterate on what they said. Use their answer when sharing the bullets point on the slide.\nAs the final part of this section, you go to slide seven about giving feedback. Here we have two prompt questions:\n\nWhat happens if you only give positive feedback? As we did previously, please share your thoughts in the chat or by speaking up.\n\nAfter two or three of them share their thoughts, you can ask the second question:\n\nWhat happens if we provide only negative feedback?\n\nGive them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form.\nNow show the cartoon about feedback and the bullets point on the slide. One more time use their answer to give examples or support this points. Mention that:\n\nFeedback can be the way you provide advice. It also allows everyone to grow.\n\n\nThe source material for good feedback is built on the above two skills, active listening and effective questioning.\n\nThe following slide (number eight) present Meetings.\n\nMeetings are one of the places where mentoring will happen and where mentors will use the skill we mention.\n\nNote we create templates for meeting as scaffolding for their mentorship task. And then introduce the GROW model.\n\n\nMentor tools. GROW Model.\nUse slides nine and ten to introduce the model and then you do the second exercise.\n\nYou will work in groups for the next exercise. You will have 10 minutes to watch the video linked in the shared doc. It is an example using the GROW model. The idea is you try to identify the steps of the model. You can re-watch the video or stop, answer, and then continue. Please use the shared doc on your group space to write your questions._\nWhen you finish, we will discuss your answer with the whole group.\n\nYou can create random groups, with no more than 3-4 people in each group. Read their answer during the exercise and choose some groups to share with the whole class. Choose each group because they add something interesting or different to the discussion. If you have a few groups, give all of them a chance to share their insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are teaching the 120 minutes version of the trainig it is time of a 5/10 minutes break away from the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise: Practice GROW model mentoring your classmate\n\n\n\nThis in an extra exercise for the 120 minutes version of the training. You will find the instruction on the 2.b exercise on the shared doc. If you are teaching the 90 minutes trainig, then you should remove the 2.b point on the shared doc.\n\n\nFinished this section with slide_ _twelve__ with a summary for GROW model.\n\n\nMentor tools. Program logistics\nThe next session introduces the Mentors Guidelines and others infrastructure and tools we developed for the champions program.\nShared slide thirteen, mention each tool, and then show the tools. The most important one is the Mentors Guidelines. You can click on the slides to open the document and go through it, showing each section, the list of resources, and the information we gather there for them.\nYou can click on the link to the other resources inside the guidelines to show them: be sure to show the google drive and the meeting templates. Finally, you can ask if they want to check the Slack channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipChecking for Access\n\n\n\nThis is an excellent time to check for access to these resources: are all in Slack and the proper channels? Do you have access to google drive and google docs? Can you copy the meeting templates and access the meeting report form?\n\n\nNow it is time for the next exercise. With the prompt “Are you ready for mentoring?” we provide space for comments, questions, and clarifications mentors need. Allow them to speak or write on the shared document or the chat. If they ask on the chat, copy those comments on the shared doc. These questions can be useful for the other cohorts. The time for this activity is 10 minutes, but take more minutes if they have good questions about the mentoring role or the program.  \nThe final exercise calls mentors to practice giving constructive feedback by filling out an anonymous feedback survey about the training. Share the link to the form on the chat or mention they can access the link on the shared note. Give 5 minutes to fill out the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipChecking completion\n\n\n\nFor this final exercise, you can also ask students to write on the chat “Done!” or “Finish!” or similar when they finish. This way, you will know, and you can end the activity when all are done. Some times this can mean before the time allocated for the exercise.",
